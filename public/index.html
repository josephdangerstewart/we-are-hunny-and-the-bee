						Though we were unable to hear each other on that bus ride,

					<h1>When we got married!</h1>
					<h2>November 28th, 2020</h2>
					<p>
						Hello family, friends, and loved ones! Thank you for coming to our wedding website.
						We have invested a lot of time and energy into this project and we are grateful for
						your willingness to visit it. We hope you all have enjoyed just a small snippet of our story!
					</p>
					<p>
						Though we already got married back in 2020, holding a small ceremony with only our immediate
						family, we are still planning on having a much larger celebration/reception in the future.
						We will keep you updated in regards to that event and are looking forward to being able
						to celebrate with you in person then!
					</p>
					<p>
						For now, we would love to share with you some of our favorite photos taken during our wedding day!
						We can’t wait for special moments with you to be captured at our future Wedding Celebration.
						Photos were taken by <a href="https://phoebeng.myportfolio.com/">Phoebe Ng</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can see our photos by clicking <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/y2CqvqfR2wsMaKhz6" target="_blank">here</a>!
					</p>
					<p>
						We love you all so much and we are so excited to see you again soon. May God bless
						you and remind you of His deep and genuine love for you today!
