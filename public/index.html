					<h1>When we're getting married</h1>
					<h2>November 28th, 2020</h2>
					<p>
						Hello family, friends, and loved ones! Thank you for coming to our wedding
						website. We have invested a lot of time and energy into this project and
						we are blessed for your willingness to experience it. We hope you all
						have enjoyed just a small snippet of our story!
					</p>
					<p>
						As you can see, we are planning on getting married November 28th of this
						year, 2020. Due to the pandemic, this wedding celebration will only be
						with immediate family members. However, we are planning on having a
						much bigger celebration with all of our family, friends, and loved
						ones whenever conditions with the pandemic improve.
					</p>
					<p>
						For now, we would love to thank each and every single person who has been
						a part of our journey since the start. We thank you for your love and support,
						showing us the grace and love of God in all that you’ve done for us.
						Though we are sadden to not be able to celebrate with you all now, we
						deeply look forward to the day when we can all celebrate together in person.
						We love you all so much and we are so excited to see you all again soon.
					</p>
					<p>May God bless you and remind you of His deep and genuine love for you today!</p>
